# Learn about CLAP

CLAP stands for **CL**ever **A**udio **P**lugin. It is an interface that
provides a stable ABI to define a standard for *Digital Audio Workstations* and
audio plugins (synthesizers, audio effects, ...) to work together.

The ABI, or **A**pplication **B**inary **I**nterface, serves as a means of
communication between a host and a plugin. It provides backwards compatibility,
that is, a plugin binary compiled with CLAP 1.x can be loaded by any other
CLAP 1.y.

To work with CLAP, include [clap/clap.h](include/clap/clap.h).
To also include the draft extensions, include [clap/all.h](include/clap/all.h).

The two most important objects are `clap_host` and `clap_plugin`.

[src/plugin-template.c](src/plugin-template.c) is a very minimal example which demonstrates how to wire a CLAP plugin.

## Entry point

The entry point is declared in [entry.h](include/clap/entry.h).

## Extensions

Most features come from extensions, which are in fact C interfaces.
```C
// host extension
const clap_host_log *log = host->extension(host, CLAP_EXT_LOG);
if (log)
   log->log(host, CLAP_LOG_INFO, "Hello World! ;^)");

// plugin extension
const clap_plugin_params *params = plugin->extension(plugin, CLAP_EXT_PARAMS);
if (params)
{
   uint32_t paramsCount = params->count(plugin);
   // ...
}
```

The extensions are defined in the [ext](include/clap/ext) folder.

Some extensions are still in the progress of being designed and they are in
the [draft](include/clap/ext/draft) folder.

An extension comes with:
- a header `#include <clap/ext/xxx.h>`
- an extension identifier: `#define CLAP_EXT_XXX "clap/XXX"`
- host interfaces are named like: `struct clap_host_xxx`
- plugin interfaces are named like: `struct clap_plugin_xxx`
- each method must have a clear thread specification

You can create your own extensions and share them. Make sure that the extension identifier:
- includes versioning in case the ABI breaks
- is a unique identifier

**All strings are valid UTF-8**.

## Fundamental extensions

This is a list of the extensions that you most likely want to implement
and use to get a basic plugin experience:
- [state](include/clap/ext/state.h), save and load the plugin state
  - [state-context](include/clap/ext/state-context.h), same as state but with additional context info (preset, duplicate, project)
  - [resource-directory](include/clap/ext/draft/resource-directory.h), host provided folder for the plugin to save extra resource like multi-samples, ... (draft)
- [params](include/clap/ext/params.h), parameters management
- [note-ports](include/clap/ext/note-ports.h), define the note ports
- [audio-ports](include/clap/ext/audio-ports.h), define the audio ports
  - [surround](include/clap/ext/surround.h), inspect surround channel mapping
  - [ambisonic](include/clap/ext/draft/ambisonic.h), inspect ambisonic channel mapping
  - [configurable-audio-ports](include/clap/ext/configurable-audio-ports.h), request the plugin to apply a given configuration
  - [audio-ports-config](include/clap/ext/audio-ports-config.h), simple list of pre-defined audio ports configurations, meant to be exposed to the user
  - [audio-ports-activation](include/clap/ext/audio-ports-activation.h), activate and deactivate a given audio port
  - [extensible-audio-ports](include/clap/ext/draft/extensible-audio-ports.h), let the host add audio ports to the plugin, this is useful for dynamic number of audio inputs (draft)
- [render](include/clap/ext/render.h), renders realtime or offline
- [latency](include/clap/ext/latency.h), report the plugin latency
- [tail](include/clap/ext/tail.h), processing tail length
- [gui](include/clap/ext/gui.h), generic gui controller
- [voice-info](include/clap/ext/voice-info.h), let the host know how many voices the plugin has, this is important for polyphonic modulations
- [track-info](include/clap/ext/track-info.h), give some info to the plugin about the track it belongs to
- [tuning](include/clap/ext/draft/tuning.h), host provided microtuning (draft)
- [triggers](include/clap/ext/draft/triggers.h), plugin's triggers, similar to parameters but stateless

## Support extensions

- [thread-check](include/clap/ext/thread-check.h), check which thread you are currently on, useful for correctness validation
- [thread-pool](include/clap/ext/thread-pool.h), use the host thread pool
- [log](include/clap/ext/log.h), lets the host aggregate plugin logs
- [timer-support](include/clap/ext/timer-support.h), lets the plugin register timer handlers
- [posix-fd-support](include/clap/ext/posix-fd-support.h), lets the plugin register I/O handlers

## Deeper Host integration

- [remote-controls](include/clap/ext/remote-controls.h), bank of controls that can be mapped on a controlles with 8 knobs
- [preset-discovery](include/clap/factory/preset-discovery.h), let the host index the plugin's preset in their native file format
- [preset-load](include/clap/ext/preset-load.h), let the host ask the plugin to load a preset
- [param-indication](include/clap/ext/param-indication.h), let the plugin know when a physical control is mapped to a parameter and if there is automation data
- [note-name](include/clap/ext/note-name.h), give a name to notes, useful for drum machines
- [transport-control](include/clap/ext/draft/transport-control.h), let the plugin control the host's transport (draft)
- [context-menu](include/clap/ext/context-menu.h), exchange context menu entries between host and plugin, let the plugin ask the host to popup its own context menu
