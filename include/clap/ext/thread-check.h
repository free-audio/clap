///
/// CLAP defines two symbolic threads:
///
/// main-thread:
///    This is the thread in which most of the interaction between the plugin and host happens.
///    This will be the same OS thread throughout the lifetime of the plug-in.
///    On macOS and Windows, this must be the thread on which gui and timer events are received
///    (i.e., the main thread of the program).
///    It isn't a realtime thread, yet this thread needs to respond fast enough to allow user interaction,
///    so it is strongly recommended plugins run long,and expensive or blocking tasks such as preset indexing
///    or asset loading in dedicated background threads started by the plugin.
///
/// audio-thread:
///    This thread can be used for realtime audio processing. Its execution should be as deterministic
///    as possible to meet the audio interface's deadline (can be <1ms). There are a
///    known set of operations that should be avoided: malloc() and free(), contended locks and mutexes,
///    I/O, waiting, and so forth.
///
///    The audio-thread is symbolic, there isn't one OS thread that remains the
///    audio-thread for the plugin lifetime. A host is may opt to have a
///    thread pool and the plugin.process() call may be scheduled on different OS threads over time.
///    However, the host must guarantee that single plugin instance will not be two audio-threads
///    at the same time.
///
///    Functions marked with [audio-thread] **ARE NOT CONCURRENT**. The host may mark any OS thread,
///    including the main-thread as the audio-thread, as long as it can guarantee that only one OS
///    thread is the audio-thread at a time in a plugin instance. The audio-thread can be seen as a
///    concurrency guard for all functions marked with [audio-thread].
///
///    The real-time constraint on the [audio-thread] interacts closely with the render extension.
///    If a plugin doesn't implement render, then that plugin must have all [audio-thread] functions
///    meet the real time standard. If the plugin does implement render, and returns true when
///    render mode is set to real-time or if the plugin advertises a hard realtime requirement, it
///    must implement realtime constraints. Host provided [audio-thread] functions can be called
///    from a plugin on the audio thread and must also therefore either meet the real-time constraint,
///    not run plugins which advertise a hard realtime constraint via render or don't implement render,
///    or expect potentially inconsistent rendering and performance from plugins when they re-enter the host.
///
///  Clap also tags some functions as [thread-safe]. Functions tagged as [thread-safe] can be called from
///  any thread unless explicitly counter-indicated (for instance [thread-safe, !audio-thread]) and may
///  be called concurrently. Since a [thread-safe] function may be called from the [audio-thread] unless
///  explicitly counter-indicated, it must also meet the realtime constraints as describes above.

// This interface is useful to do runtime checks and make
// sure that the functions are called on the correct threads.
// It is highly recommended that hosts implement this extension.
