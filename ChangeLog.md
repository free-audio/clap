### Notes regarding extension ID change after draft stabilization

We changed the extension ID in the process of stabilization which leads to a **break**.

To mitigate this transition, we've provided compatibility extension IDs which can be used to match and use the latest draft extensions as they are 100% compatible.

For example, `CLAP_EXT_CONTEXT_MENU` for the stable ID and `CLAP_EXT_CONTEXT_MENU_COMPAT` for the draft ID.

As you can see in [extension-id](conventions/extension-id.md), we introduced some rules, so this kind of break won't happen again.

We may decide to remove the `*_COMPAT` IDs in the future once their usage becomes antiquated.

## Removed draft extensions

* `CLAP_EXT_CHECK_FOR_UPDATE` wasn't used and it's design needed more thought.
* `CLAP_EXT_MIDI_MAPPING` wasn't used. MIDI2 seems to do it better, and the interface wasn't satisfying.
* `CLAP_EXT_CV` the interface wasn't satisfying.

## Stabilize factory

* `CLAP_PRESET_DISCOVERY_FACTORY_ID`

Note: we kept the last draft factory ID in order to not break plugins already using it.

## Plugin State Converter

* Introduction of a new factory which provides a plugin state convertion mechanism.

## Refactoring

* `clap_plugin_id_t` was renamed to `clap_universal_plugin_id_t` to make it clear that it can describe more than just a CLAP plugin ID.
* `clap_timestamp_t` was renamed to `clap_timestamp` to be consistent with other types, like e.g. `clap_id`. Also it was moved to a separate header as `CLAP_PRESET_DISCOVERY_FACTORY_ID` was stabilized.

## Documentation

* [events.h](include/clap/events.h): Clarify how "Port Channel Key NoteID" matching works
* [events.h](include/clap/events.h): Clarify how `clap_event_note` fields map to MIDI, Host, etc...
* [events.h](include/clap/events.h): Expand clap note expression documentation
* [plugin.h](include/clap/plugin.h): Style cleanup
* [params.h](include/clap/ext/params.h): Fix incorrect function name reference

## Plugin Template

* [plugin-template.c](src/plugin-template.c): implement thread-safe plugin entry init counter

## Organization

* `clap.h` no longer includes headers from `ext/draft` or `factory/draft`. Draft extension and factory headers must now be explicitly included, either individually or via the `all.h` header.

## Other changes

* [voice-info.h](include/clap/ext/voice-info.h): Make the voice info id `CLAP_CONSTEXPR` like all other ids
* [preset-load.h](include/clap/ext/preset-load.h): Make the preset load id and compat id `CLAP_CONSTEXPR` like all other ids

* [preset-load.h](include/clap/ext/draft/preset-load.h): load from URI instead of path, making the extension more powerful

  * Add a CLAP_VERSION_GE(maj,min,rev), _EQ and _LT macro.
  * Remove the uint32_t cast from CLAP_VERSION_MAJOR, _MINOR, and _REVISION macro, and introduce it to the CLAP_VERSION_INIT macro.
  * If you rely on these macros being a uint32_t or parse this header using external software, this may be a breaking change.
